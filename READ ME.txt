This program code splits the frames of video and saves into "images" folder.
Then it loads the images stored in 'images' folder.
Performs thresholding and saves threshold images in folder "threshold_images".
Then it finds the centre points of droplet in threshold image.
Finally it captures a surrounding window around droplet and saves in "final_images".
______________________________________________________________________________________

Following action should be taken before running the code for smooth operation.
Create a folder named "images" in the folder where code has been placed.
Put all the holography images in "images" folder.
Then create two more folders with names "threshold_images" and "final_images".
Make following change into the code file "separateFrames.m".
* Line-2:
	Write the file name of Input video.
* Line-7:
	Define complete working directory of "images" folder.

Now make following change into the code file "find_region_around_droplet.m" and run it.

* Line-10:
	Define the surrounding window size.
* Line-11:
	Define complete directory where code is present.

When the program execution is complete,
then folder "images" will contain all the frames of input video.
And the folder "threshold_images" will contain all the threshold images.
Folder "final_images" will contain images of surrounding window around droplet.

Code will also create a video file with name "Threshold_Video.avi".
It will be created in the same folder where the code is.
This video shows the threshold result.
